# File Structure Document for "Ramen Munching"

## Introduction

A well-structured file organization is key to the success of any development project. It not only simplifies the development process but also ensures seamless collaboration among team members. For "Ramen Munching," a blog dedicated to ramen recipes, history, and culture, an organized file system supports efficient content management, easy navigation, and maintainability. By adhering to best practices, the file structure we outline will enable developers and non-technical collaborators alike to understand and engage with the project easily, promoting both creativity and productivity.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

"Ramen Munching" employs a modern tech stack that enhances its functionality and user experience. The frontend is developed using Next.js 14 and TypeScript, with styling powered by Tailwind CSS and Radix UI to create a responsive and visually appealing design. Backend and data storage needs are handled by Supabase, ensuring reliable data management and easy user authentication services. Additional tools include AI enhancements using Claude AI for content generation and the Cursor IDE for efficient coding with real-time suggestions. This tech stack influences the file structure, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

## Root Directory Structure

At the root of the project, the directory structure is designed to compartmentalize the aspects of both frontend and backend development. Key directories include:

1. **src/** - This is where the core source code lives, containing separate folders for "components" (reusable UI elements), "pages" (corresponds to various routes and major components), "styles" (CSS and Tailwind configuration), and "lib" (utility functions and configurations).

2. **public/** - Houses public assets such as images, icons, and any static files that do not go through a build pipeline.

3. **.next/** - Compiles output from the Next.js build process, typically not manually edited.

4. **backend/** - Contains server-side code managed by Supabase, including API endpoints and database schema specifications.

Important files include:

- `package.json`: Lists project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
- `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration settings.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
- `.env`: Environment variables for configuring sensitive data like API keys.

## Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration and environment files play a crucial role in setting the operational parameters of the "Ramen Munching" blog. The `package.json` file is essential for managing Node.js dependencies such as Next.js and Tailwind CSS, while the `next.config.js` file governs the parameters specific to the Next.js framework, ensuring optimal build and runtime settings. Tailwind CSS settings can be aggressively personalized through `tailwind.config.js`, tailoring the look and responsiveness of the UI.

The environment file, `.env`, is vital for storing sensitive information like database URLs and API keys. This ensures that certificates, authentication credentials, and environment-specific variables are not hard-coded within the source files, maintaining security and flexibility.

## Documentation Structure

Proper documentation is essential for team collaboration and long-term maintainability. The project includes structured documentation to support developers in onboarding, troubleshooting, and extending the blogâ€™s functionalities:

1. **README.md**: Provides an overview, setup instructions, and basic usage guidelines for the project.

2. **docs/**: Contains detailed documentation files, including developer guides, architectural decisions, API documentation, and style guides.

By hosting comprehensive documents, knowledge is shared and quality assurance is maintained, allowing anyone interacting with the project to gain insight and contribute effectively.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

Maintaining a well-organized file structure is fundamental to the development and sustainability of "Ramen Munching." This structure not only supports efficient development and seamless collaboration but also encourages community participation as users interact with the blog. Unique to this project is its modern tech stack, which influences the file organization, promoting a modular, maintainable, and scalable system. By adhering to these principles, "Ramen Munching" is equipped to deliver a rich culinary experience centered around the beloved dish of ramen, while meeting its long-term goal of nurturing a community of enthusiasts.
